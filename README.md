# double-pendulum-code

A project made to computationally determine the chaotic nature of the double pendulum system by simulating its physical behavior using the Runge-Kutta method.
The double pendulum system is very difficult to reason about through classical, Newtonian mechanics. However, with the help of Lagrangian mechanics, especially
with the use of L = T - V (the Lagrangian), the problem becomes a matter of solving a few differential equations.

Code was written in Java, using Swing and AWT libraries for the graphics/animations.

This is a copy of the local code used to run the double pendulum project. Note that some files were lost on one of my older computers, but these were ones that I had
recovered from a past GitHub account.
